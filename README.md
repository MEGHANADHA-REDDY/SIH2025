Smart Student Hub
A centralized student achievement management platform that transforms scattered student records into comprehensive digital portfolios.

🎯 Problem Statement
Despite increasing digitization in education, student achievements ranging from academic excellence to participation in curricular and extracurricular activities remain scattered across various departments or lost in paper-based records. This gap hampers institutional efficiency and limits students' ability to build verified portfolios for job applications, higher education admissions, and skill recognition.

Dynamic Student Dashboard: Real-time updates on academic performance, attendance, and credit-based activities

Activity Tracker: Upload and validate participation in seminars, conferences, MOOCs, internships, and extracurriculars

Faculty Approval Panel: Faculty/admin can approve uploaded records to maintain credibility

Auto-Generated Digital Portfolio: Downloadable and shareable verified student portfolio in PDF or web link format

Analytics & Reporting: Generate reports for NAAC, AICTE, NIRF, or internal evaluations

Integration Support: Link with existing LMS, ERP, or digital university platforms
