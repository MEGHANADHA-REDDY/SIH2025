✅ **Easy to understand** - No external API setup required  
✅ **Non-editable** - Read-only sheets that cannot be modified by viewers  
✅ **Shareable** - Generate unique shareable links for each student  
✅ **Built-in** - Part of your existing application with no external dependencies

## 📊 Database Schema

### `student_sheets` Table
Stores the main sheet information for each student:

```sql
CREATE TABLE student_sheets (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INTEGER REFERENCES students(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    share_token VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(student_id)
);
```

### `student_sheet_entries` Table
Stores individual activity entries for each sheet:

```sql
CREATE TABLE student_sheet_entries (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    sheet_id INTEGER REFERENCES student_sheets(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    activity_id INTEGER,
    student_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    project_url TEXT,
    course_name VARCHAR(255),
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    faculty_name VARCHAR(255),
    certificate_id VARCHAR(100),
    validation_score VARCHAR(50),
    entry_date VARCHAR(50),
    activity_type VARCHAR(100),
    category VARCHAR(100),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Student Endpoints

#### Get My Sheet
```http
GET /api/sheets/my-sheet
Authorization: Bearer <student_token>
```
Returns the student's own sheet data.

#### Get Share URL
```http
GET /api/sheets/share-url
Authorization: Bearer <student_token>
```
Returns the shareable URL for the student's sheet.

#### Regenerate Share Token
```http
POST /api/sheets/regenerate-token
Authorization: Bearer <student_token>
```
Generates a new share token for security.

### Public Endpoints

#### View Shared Sheet
```http
GET /api/sheets/shared/{shareToken}
```
Public endpoint to view a student's sheet using share token.

### Faculty/Admin Endpoints

#### Get Student Sheet
```http
GET /api/sheets/student/{studentId}
Authorization: Bearer <faculty_or_admin_token>
```
View any student's sheet (faculty/admin only).

#### Get All Sheets
```http
GET /api/sheets/all
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
```
Get list of all student sheets (admin only).

#### Get Statistics
```http
GET /api/sheets/stats
Authorization: Bearer <admin_token>
```
Get system-wide sheet statistics.

## 🌐 Frontend Integration

### Shared Sheet Viewer
The system includes a beautiful, responsive web interface at:
```
/sheet/{shareToken}
```

**Features:**
- 📱 Mobile-responsive design
- 📊 Summary statistics (approved, rejected, success rate)
- 📋 Detailed activity table
- 🔗 Clickable project links
- 🎨 Status badges with colors
- 📅 Formatted dates

### Example Share URLs
- API: `http://localhost:5000/api/sheets/shared/abc123-def456-ghi789`
- Web: `http://localhost:3000/sheet/abc123-def456-ghi789`

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Automatic Sheet Creation
When faculty approves/rejects an activity:
1. System checks if student has a sheet
2. Creates new sheet if none exists (with unique share token)
3. Adds activity entry to the sheet

### 2. Data Processing
Each entry contains:
- Student information
- Activity details
- Faculty approval/rejection info
- Timestamps and status

### 3. Sharing System
- Each student gets a unique UUID-based share token
- Share tokens can be regenerated for security
- Public access doesn't require authentication

## 📈 Features

### ✅ **Read-Only Design**
- Viewers cannot edit or modify data
- Data integrity is maintained
- Only system can add new entries

### 🔗 **Easy Sharing**
- Unique shareable links for each student
- No login required for viewing
- Links can be shared via email, messaging, etc.

### 📊 **Rich Data Display**
- Summary statistics
- Detailed activity history
- Status indicators
- Project links
- Faculty information

### 🔒 **Security Features**
- UUID-based share tokens (impossible to guess)
- Tokens can be regenerated if compromised
- Role-based access control for management

### 📱 **Responsive Design**
- Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Clean, professional appearance
- Easy to read and navigate

2. Go to "My Sheet" or dashboard
3. Copy share link to share with others
4. Regenerate link if needed for security

### For Faculty
1. Approve/reject student activities (automatic)
2. View student sheets from faculty dashboard
3. Access detailed activity history

### For Public Viewers
1. Receive share link from student
2. Click link to view read-only sheet
3. See all approved/rejected activities
4. Access project links if available

## 🔍 Monitoring & Analytics

### Admin Statistics
- Total sheets created
- Activity approval rates
- Department-wise statistics
- Recent activity feed

### Health Monitoring
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/webhook/health
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Sheet not found" error**
   - Check if share token is correct
   - Verify student has activities

2. **Empty sheet displayed**
   - Student hasn't had any activities approved/rejected yet
   - System will show empty state with helpful message

3. **Database errors**
   - Ensure database is running
   - Check database connection in .env file

### Debug Mode
Set `NODE_ENV=development` for detailed error messages.
